For my wireless card, the Alfa AC1900, I had to compile the module to get it to
work on Linux since it wasn't already part of the kernel.

To do this you will need:

1. `make` and `gcc` or `clang`
1. `kernel-debug-devel` package
1. sudo permission to `insmod` the compiled module

This[^1] is the only one I found that worked for me on the latest stable linux
kernel, which as of today on Fedora is 5.17.6.

First you need to install the kernel development header package.

```
# Fedora
sudo dnf install kernel-debug-devel

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Next you need to make the module.

```
git clone https://github.com/morrownr/8814au.git
cd 8814au
```

Now simply `make` the module using the `make` command and use `insmod` to load
it.

```
make -j16
sudo sh -c "modprobe cfg80211; insmod /home/codebam/8814au/8814au.ko"
```

If everything worked successfully, you should now have a loaded 8814au module
that you can use along with your wireless card to connect to WiFi.
